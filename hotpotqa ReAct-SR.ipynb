There were many variants produced, often under license which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibers, but 40 caliber was the most common version.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships. This led to their being used ashore during World War I as coastal defense guns, the first tank guns and as anti-aircraft guns, whether on improvised or specialized HA/LA mounts.\n",

Jang Hoon (along with Jang Cheol-soo and Juhn Jai-hong) honed his directorial skills as an assistant director under Kim Ki-duk. His debut film Rough Cut (2008), about a gangster who wants to become an actor and an actor who thinks he is as tough as a gangster, was written and produced by Kim. Rough Cut was much more commercially oriented than Kim's own movies, and the star power of its two leading actors So Ji-sub and Kang Ji-hwan propelled the indie to more than one million admissions, resulting in a profit 10 times its low budget.[1][2].\n",

      "Observation 3: A Taxi Driver (Korean: 택시운전사) is a 2017 South Korean historical action drama film[3] directed by Jang Hoon and written by Eom Yu-na, with Song Kang-ho starring in the lead role, alongside Thomas Kretschmann, Yoo Hae-jin, and Ryu Jun-yeol.[4][5]. Based on a real-life story, the film centers on a taxi driver from Seoul who unintentionally becomes involved in the events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. It is based on German journalist Jürgen Hinzpeter's interactions with driver Kim Sa-bok; however, as very little information on Kim was  known at the time the film was made, most elements regarding his life and the events that happened to him outside of Gwangju are fictional.. The film was released on August 2, 2017, in South Korea.[6] It was very positively received by critics, who praised its unique approach to depicting the Gwangju Uprising events, emotional weight, as well as the main character and his relationship with Hinzpeter, and was selected as the South Korean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards.[7][8] The film was a notable commercial success: it was the second highest grossing film of 2017 in South Korea, and currently stands as the twelfth highest-grossing South Korean film in history.[9][10]. The film centers around the Gwangju Uprising that occurred from May 18, 1980 to May 27, 1980 and it is estimated to have led to 2,000 people being killed.\n",

Dísir may act as protective spirits of Norse clans. It is possible that their original function was that of fertility goddesses who were the object of both private and official worship called dísablót,[1] and their veneration may derive from the worship of the spirits of the dead.[2] The dísir, like the valkyries, norns, and vættir, are always referred collectively in surviving references.[1][3] The North Germanic dísir and West Germanic Idisi are believed by some scholars to be related due to linguistic and mythological similarities,[4] but the direct evidence of Anglo-Saxon and Continental German mythology is limited. The dísir play roles in Norse texts that resemble those of fylgjur, valkyries, and norns, so that some have suggested that dísir is a broad term including the other beings.[2].

The ancient kingdom of Kalinga, which was invaded by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (which was again won back from them by King Kharavela) in 261 BCE resulting in the Kalinga War, coincides with the borders of modern-day Odisha.[20] The modern boundaries of Odisha were demarcated by the Indian government when Orissa Province was established on 1 April 1936, consisting of the Odia-speaking districts of Bihar and Orissa Province.[20] The 1st of April is celebrated as Utkala Dibasa (lit. 'Odisha Day').[21] Cuttack was made the capital of the region by Anantavarman Chodaganga in c. 1135,[22] after which the city was used as the capital by many rulers, through the British era until 1948.\n",

      "Observation 2: ParaNorman is a 2012 American stop-motion animated comedy horror film directed by Sam Fell and Chris Butler (the latter's feature directorial debut), and written by Butler.[4] Produced by Laika, the film stars the voices of Kodi Smit-McPhee, Jodelle Ferland, Bernard Hill, Tucker Albrizzi, Anna Kendrick, Casey Affleck, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Leslie Mann, Jeff Garlin, Elaine Stritch,  Tempestt Bledsoe, Alex Borstein, and John Goodman. It is the first stop-motion film to use a 3-D color printer to create character faces, and only the second to be shot in 3-D.[5] In the film, Norman Babcock, a young boy who can communicate with ghosts, is given the task of ending a 300-year-old witch's curse on his Massachusetts town.. The idea of ParaNorman came from Butler, who thought making such a movie for kids could help express the challenges kids face growing up, after realizing that zombie films often contained a degree of social commentary. Production of the stop-motion animation feature took place at Laika's studio in Hillsboro, Oregon for three years, with the animating stage of production lasting about two years and beginning in late 2009.

Original models of the Sord M5 are relatively small by home computing standards, with a built-in keyboard with rubber keys, similar to the ZX Spectrum, which is also sold in many countries such as the United Kingdom itself, Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, Singapore, Malaysia, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Greece, Israel and Hong Kong as the Sord M5 Creative Computer,[5] which included a carrying case for the computer. The specifications of the computer are very similar to the MSX, a computer that likely forced the Sord M5 (along with many similar Japanese computers) out of the market by the mid-1980s..

Øye and Bøe were both born in 1975 (Øye on 21 November and Bøe on 25 October) and have known each other since they met in the same class at school. Their first musical collaboration was a comedic rap about a teacher.[2] At sixteen, they played together in the band Skog (\"forest\") with two other friends, releasing one EP, Tom Tids Tale, before breaking up and later forming the Kings duo.. The duo was signed to the American label Kindercore after appearing in European festivals during the summer of 1999. After a spell living in London in 2001, they released their debut album Quiet Is the New Loud.\n",

      "Observation 2: Belle & Sebastian are a Scottish indie pop band formed in Glasgow in 1996. Led by Stuart Murdoch, the band has released twelve studio albums.[5][6] They are often compared with acts such as the Smiths[7][8] and Nick Drake.[5][6] The name \"Belle & Sebastian\" comes from Belle et Sébastien, a 1965 children's book by French writer Cécile Aubry later adapted for television. Though consistently lauded by critics,[9][10] Belle & Sebastian's \"wistful pop\"[11] has enjoyed only limited commercial success.[9]. In 1994, Stuart Murdoch and Stuart David both enrolled at Stow College's Beatbox programme for unemployed musicians in Glasgow.[5] Together, with music professor Alan Rankine (formerly of The Associates), they recorded some demos, which in 1996 were picked up by the college's Music Business course that produces and releases one single each year on the college's label, Electric Honey. As Murdoch had a number of songs already and the label was extremely impressed with the demos, he was granted permission to record a full-length album, which was recorded mostly live over three days, entitled Tigermilk..\n",

He was then captured by National Transitional Council (NTC) forces and killed shortly afterwards.[1]. The NTC initially claimed Gaddafi died from injuries sustained in a firefight when loyalist forces attempted to free him, although a video of his last moments shows rebel fighters beating him and one of them sodomizing him with a bayonet[2] before he was shot several times.[3].

Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, Gaddafi later ruled according to his own Third International Theory.. Born near Sirte, Italian Libya, to a poor Bedouin Arab family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the Western-backed Senussi monarchy of Idris in a 1969 coup.

      "Observation 5: The Third International Theory (Arabic: نظرية عالمية ثالثة), also known as Third Universal Theory and Gaddafism, was the style of government proposed by Muammar Gaddafi on 15 April 1973 in his Zuwara speech,[6] on which his government, the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, was officially based. It combined elements of Arab nationalism, Nasserism,[7] Anti-imperialism, Islamic socialism, African nationalism, Pan-Arabism,[8] and it was partly influenced by the principles of direct democracy.[4] The theory also contained elements of Islamic fundamentalism, as Gaddafi argued that Muslims needed to return to God and the Qur'an and rejected formal interpretation of the Qur'an as blasphemy.[1]. It has similarities with the system of Yugoslav socialist self-management in Titoist Yugoslavia during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s as developed by Edvard Kardelj.[4] It was also inspired in part by the \"Little Red Book\" of Mao Zedong and the Three Worlds Theory.[9] It was proposed by Gaddafi as an alternative to capitalism and Marxism–Leninism for Third World countries, based on the stated belief that both of these ideologies had been proven invalid.[1]. The Higher Council for National Guidance was created to disseminate and implement this theory, and it found partial realization in Libya, a self-proclaimed utopian model state.[10] The fall of Gaddafi and his death in 2011 led to the disestablishment of his system and its replacement by the National Transitional Council..

People with delirium may experience other neuropsychiatric disturbances, including changes in psychomotor activity (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed level of activity), disrupted sleep-wake cycle, emotional disturbances, disturbances of consciousness, or, altered state of consciousness, as well as perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions), although these features are not required for diagnosis.. Diagnostically, delirium encompasses both the syndrome of acute confusion and its underlying organic process[3] known as an acute encephalopathy.[1] The cause of delirium may be either a disease process inside the brain or a process outside the brain that nonetheless affects the brain.\n",

Set in the fictional borough of Walford in the East End of London, the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Within eight months of the show's original launch, it had reached the number one spot in BARB's television ratings, and has consistently remained among the top-rated series in Britain. Four EastEnders episodes are listed in the all-time top 10 most-watched programmes in the UK, including the number one spot, when over 30 million watched the 1986 Christmas Day episode.[1] EastEnders has been important in the history of British television drama, tackling many subjects that are considered to be controversial or taboo in British culture, and portraying a social life previously unseen on UK mainstream television.[2].

He had several students who later became martial arts masters in their own right, the most famous among them being Bruce Lee.. Ip Man was born as Ip Kai-man (葉繼問) to Ip Oi-dor (葉靄多) and Ng Shui (吳瑞) as the third of four children. He grew up in a wealthy family in Foshan (Fatshan), Guangdong (Kwangtung), and received traditional Chinese education, alongside his elder brother Ip Kai-gak (葉繼格), elder sister Ip Wan-mei (葉允媚), and younger sister Ip Wan-hum (葉允堪).[3]. Ip started learning Wing Chun from Chan Wah-shun when he was 9[4] or 13.[5][6] Chan was 57 at the time, and Ip became Chan's 16th and last student.[7][8] Due to Chan's age, he was able to train Ip for only three years before suffering a mild stroke in 1909 and retiring to his village.\n",

He was born in Dutchess County, New York on April 5, 1819. Early in life, living in Cato Four Corners (later Meridian, in Cayuga County, New York), at the age of 16, he invented a method for raising ships out of the water for repairs by sinking a water-filled box beneath it, then forcing the water out through pumps in order to raise the ship.[1]. Throughout the 1840s, Timby perfected a revolving gun turret for use on land or water. He constructed a 21-foot-long (6.4 m) model and brought it to Washington but met with little success, as war was not imminent.\n",

This can also be considered an \"actor's role,\" which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \"playing themselves\", as in some forms of experimental performance art.. Formerly, in ancient Greece and the medieval world, and in England at the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys.[3] While Ancient Rome did allow female stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking parts.\n",

Filmed at the Augusta Civic Center on July 11, 2004, the performance showcases Slayer's 1986 album, Reign in Blood, played in its entirety with the four original band members on a set resembling their 1986 \"Reign in Pain\" tour. Still Reigning was voted \"best live DVD\" by the readers of Revolver magazine, and received gold certification in 2005.. The DVD is notable for the finale, which features Slayer covered in stage blood while performing the song \"Raining Blood\", leading to a demanding mixing process plagued by production and technical difficulties. The DVD's producer Kevin Shirley spent hours replacing cymbal and drum hits one-by-one.\n",

The series features a species of nocturnal creatures known as gargoyles that turn to stone during the day.[5] After spending a thousand years in an enchanted petrified state, the gargoyles (who have been transported from medieval Scotland) are reawakened in modern-day New York City, and take on roles as the city's secret night-time protectors.[6]. Gargoyles was noted for its relatively dark tone, complex story arcs, and melodrama; character arcs were heavily employed throughout the series, as were Shakespearean themes. The series also received favorable comparisons to Cybersix, Batman: The Animated Series, and X-Men. A video game adaptation and a spin-off comic series were released in 1995.\n",

On Barcelona's side, the rule saw Johan Cruyff choosing not to pick Michael Laudrup in his squad for the final which caused Capello to state after the game: \"Laudrup was the guy I feared but Cruyff left him out, and that was his mistake\".[2] Laudrup left Barcelona for their arch-rival, Real Madrid, at the end of the season..

The region was sometimes called the Indian Empire, though not officially.[16]. As India, it was a founding member of the League of Nations, a participating nation in the Summer Olympics in 1900, 1920, 1928, 1932, and 1936, and a founding member of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945.[17]. This system of governance was instituted on 28 June 1858, when, after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the rule of the East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria[18] (who, in 1876, was proclaimed Empress of India).\n",

The history of the Emirate was dominated by the 'Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the British Empire for supremacy in Central Asia. This period was characterized by European influence in Afghanistan. The Emirate of Afghanistan continued the Durrani Empire's war with the Sikh Empire, losing control of the former Afghan stronghold of the Valley of Peshawar at the Battle of Nowshera on 14 March 1823.

The series stars Robert Pastorelli as the manager of a bicycle messenger service in New York City.[1][2]. As a young man in the 1960s, Johnny Verona had hoped to become a rock star. To earn the money he needed to buy a guitar previously owned by his idol, Jimi Hendrix, that he saw in a store window, he took a job as a bicycle messenger for Ed Foley Couriers.[3] After buying the guitar, he joined a rock band in 1968 which enjoyed some success playing in clubs.[3] When a record company offered him a solo contract in 1971, the idealistic Johnny turned it down because the contract did not include his fellow band members.[2][3]. Denied his dream of being a rock music star, Johnny used the knowledge he had acquired as a bicycle courier to open his own bicycle delivery company in Manhattan.[1][2][3] Called Double Rush, it offers a rush delivery service, guaranteeing delivery within 45 minutes, and a \"double rush\" service which promises delivery within 20 minutes.[3] Johnny goes through ups and downs as he struggles to run the company in the face of competition from the increased use of fax machines and the Internet in the mid-1990s,[3][4] as well as from his former employer Ed Foley Couriers, now run by Ed Foley and his daughter Kate.[3] His young employees constantly remind Johnny of his missed chance to be a rock star in the 1970s,[5] and he is prone to musing about it.[2] A gruff but soft-hearted and fatherly man, he takes an interest in the personal lives and well-being of his employees at Double Rush.[2][6].\n",

There were many variants produced, often under license which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibers, but 40 caliber was the most common version.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships. This led to their being used ashore during World War I as coastal defense guns, the first tank guns and as anti-aircraft guns, whether on improvised or specialized HA/LA mounts.\n",

The central premise of Moneyball is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the front office) over the past century is outdated, subjective, and often flawed. That the statistics traditionally used to gauge players, such as stolen bases, runs batted in, and batting average, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game.[1] Sabermetrics and statistical analysis had demonstrated, for example, that on-base percentage and slugging percentage are better measures of batting.\n",

People with delirium may experience other neuropsychiatric disturbances, including changes in psychomotor activity (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed level of activity), disrupted sleep-wake cycle, emotional disturbances, disturbances of consciousness, or, altered state of consciousness, as well as perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions), although these features are not required for diagnosis.. Diagnostically, delirium encompasses both the syndrome of acute confusion and its underlying organic process[3] known as an acute encephalopathy.[1] The cause of delirium may be either a disease process inside the brain or a process outside the brain that nonetheless affects the brain.\n",

      "Observation 1: Theodore Ruggles Timby (5 April 1819 – 9 November 1909) is credited as the inventor of the revolving gun turret that was used on the USS Monitor, the ironclad warship that fought in the American Civil War. He was born in Dutchess County, New York on April 5, 1819. Early in life, living in Cato Four Corners (later Meridian, in Cayuga County, New York), at the age of 16, he invented a method for raising ships out of the water for repairs by sinking a water-filled box beneath it, then forcing the water out through pumps in order to raise the ship.[1]. Throughout the 1840s, Timby perfected a revolving gun turret for use on land or water. He constructed a 21-foot-long (6.4 m) model and brought it to Washington but met with little success, as war was not imminent.\n",

In cooperative board games, all players win or lose the game together. These games should not be confused with noncompetitive games, such as The Ungame, which simply do not have victory conditions or any set objective to complete.[3]  While adventure board games with role playing and dungeon crawl elements like Gloomhaven may be included, pure tabletop role-playing games like Descent: Journeys in the Dark are excluded as they have potentially infinite victory conditions with persistent player characters. Furthermore, games in which players compete together in two or more groups, teams or partnerships (such as Axis & Allies, and card games like Bridge and Spades) fall outside of this definition, even though there is temporary cooperation between some of the players. Multiplayer conflict games like Diplomacy may also feature temporary cooperation during the course of the game.\n",

On Barcelona's side, the rule saw Johan Cruyff choosing not to pick Michael Laudrup in his squad for the final which caused Capello to state after the game: \"Laudrup was the guy I feared but Cruyff left him out, and that was his mistake\".[2] Laudrup left Barcelona for their arch-rival, Real Madrid, at the end of the season..

The region was sometimes called the Indian Empire, though not officially.[16]. As India, it was a founding member of the League of Nations, a participating nation in the Summer Olympics in 1900, 1920, 1928, 1932, and 1936, and a founding member of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945.[17]. This system of governance was instituted on 28 June 1858, when, after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the rule of the East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria[18] (who, in 1876, was proclaimed Empress of India).\n",

Beckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 at age 17.[15] With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice and the UEFA Champions League in 1999.[15] He then played four seasons with Real Madrid,[16] winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club.[17] In July 2007, Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy.[18] While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with AC Milan in 2009 and 2010. He was the first British footballer to play 100 UEFA Champions League games.[15] He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career, during which he won 19 major trophies.[19][20]. In international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996, at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure.[21][22] He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cup tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006 and two UEFA European Championship tournaments, in 2000 and 2004.\n",

The series stars Robert Pastorelli as the manager of a bicycle messenger service in New York City.[1][2]. As a young man in the 1960s, Johnny Verona had hoped to become a rock star. To earn the money he needed to buy a guitar previously owned by his idol, Jimi Hendrix, that he saw in a store window, he took a job as a bicycle messenger for Ed Foley Couriers.[3] After buying the guitar, he joined a rock band in 1968 which enjoyed some success playing in clubs.[3] When a record company offered him a solo contract in 1971, the idealistic Johnny turned it down because the contract did not include his fellow band members.[2][3]. Denied his dream of being a rock music star, Johnny used the knowledge he had acquired as a bicycle courier to open his own bicycle delivery company in Manhattan.[1][2][3] Called Double Rush, it offers a rush delivery service, guaranteeing delivery within 45 minutes, and a \"double rush\" service which promises delivery within 20 minutes.[3] Johnny goes through ups and downs as he struggles to run the company in the face of competition from the increased use of fax machines and the Internet in the mid-1990s,[3][4] as well as from his former employer Ed Foley Couriers, now run by Ed Foley and his daughter Kate.[3] His young employees constantly remind Johnny of his missed chance to be a rock star in the 1970s,[5] and he is prone to musing about it.[2] A gruff but soft-hearted and fatherly man, he takes an interest in the personal lives and well-being of his employees at Double Rush.[2][6].\n",

Regarded as one of his most significant works, the album was the vehicle for Bowie's performance persona the Thin White Duke. Co-produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin, Station to Station was mainly recorded at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California, in late 1975, after Bowie completed shooting the film The Man Who Fell to Earth; the cover art featured a still from the film. During the sessions, Bowie was dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and later said that he recalled almost nothing of the production.. The commercial success of his previous release, Young Americans (1975), allowed Bowie greater freedom when he began recording his next album.\n",

Published in 1623, the play is loosely based on events that occurred between 1508 and 1513 surrounding Giovanna d'Aragona, Duchess of Amalfi (d. 1511), whose father, Enrico d'Aragona, Marquis of Gerace, was an illegitimate son of Ferdinand I of Naples. As in the play, she secretly married Antonio Beccadelli di Bologna after the death of her first husband Alfonso I Piccolomini, Duke of Amalfi.. The play begins as a love story, when the Duchess marries beneath her class, and ends as a nightmarish tragedy as her two brothers undertake their revenge, destroying themselves in the process.\n",
